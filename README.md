## Task 1:
Extract programmatically the list of Earth Meteorite Landings from this dataset: [https://data.nasa.gov/docs/legacy/meteorite_landings/gh4g-9sfh.json](https://data.nasa.gov/docs/legacy/meteorite_landings/gh4g-9sfh.json)  
- How many entries are in the dataset?  
- What is the name and mass of the most massive meteorite in this dataset?

⚠️ **Provide your solution as a Pull Request to this repository.** ⚠️

**NOTE:** Please elaborate how did you get the results, provide the code or any means which you used to get to the results (regardless of the format/tools/framework which were used). Result itself is not sufficient.
